"""
Customer Service Multi-Agent System
Built with OpenAI Swarm Framework

This demonstrates the power of multi-agent coordination. Instead of one
agent trying to handle everything, we have specialized agents that each
excel at their specific domain. They collaborate by handing off 
conversations to each other when appropriate.

The system includes:
- Triage Agent: Routes conversations to the right specialist
- Sales Agent: Handles product questions and sales
- Support Agent: Helps with technical issues
- Refund Agent: Processes returns and refunds

Watch how naturally these agents work together, just like a real
customer service team.
