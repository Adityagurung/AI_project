AI Capstone Project - Overview

Project Name: End-to-End AI Application Development
Duration: 15 Days
Daily Commitment: 6 Hours

Project Phases:

Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-3)
Build RAG pipeline and three mini-projects:
- FAQ Assistant with conversation memory
- YouTube Podcast Summarizer
- Internal Docs Assistant
Key technologies: OpenAI, Qdrant, LangChain

Phase 2: AI Agents (Days 4-6)
Implement agentic behavior:
- Function calling and tool use
- OpenAI Agents SDK
- PydanticAI framework
- Model-Context Protocol (MCP)

Phase 3: Evaluation & Testing (Days 7-9)
Build comprehensive testing framework:
- Gold standard datasets
- Retrieval metrics (Precision, Recall, MRR, NDCG)
- LLM-as-a-Judge
- Test-driven prompt engineering

Phase 4: Coding Agent (Days 10-11)
Create a Django site constructor:
- Automated code generation
- Full project scaffolding
- Multi-file coordination

Phase 5: Production & Monitoring (Days 12-13)
Deploy with full observability:
- Grafana dashboards for metrics
- LangWatch for AI monitoring
- Evidently for data quality
- Guardrails for safety

Phase 6: Capstone Project (Days 14-15)
Build custom AI application:
- Design your own project
- Apply all learned concepts
- Production-ready code

Technical Stack:
- Python 3.10+
- OpenAI API (GPT-3.5/4)
- Qdrant Vector Database
- FastAPI for web services

Budget: $5-10 for OpenAI API usage
Requirements: Basic Python, VS Code, OpenAI API key

Learning Outcomes:
- Master RAG architecture
- Build AI agents
- Production deployment
- Testing and monitoring
- Portfolio of 6+ projects
