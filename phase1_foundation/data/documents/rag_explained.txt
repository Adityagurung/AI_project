Understanding Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

What is RAG?
RAG combines information retrieval with language model generation. Instead of relying only on the model's training data, RAG first retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base, then uses that to generate accurate responses.

How RAG Works:

1. Document Ingestion
Documents are split into smaller chunks (typically 500-1500 tokens). Each chunk becomes a vector embedding using models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. These embeddings are stored in a vector database like Qdrant.

2. Query Processing
When you ask a question, it's also converted to a vector embedding. The system searches the vector database for chunks most similar to your query. The top 3-10 most relevant chunks are retrieved.

3. Response Generation
Retrieved chunks are combined with your question and sent to the language model (like GPT-4). The model generates a response grounded in the retrieved information.

Advantages of RAG:
- Reduces hallucinations by using real data
- Can use up-to-date information without retraining
- More cost-effective than fine-tuning
- Allows source citation
- Easy to update knowledge base

Best Practices:
1. Chunk Size: 800-1200 tokens works well
2. Overlap: Use 100-200 token overlap between chunks
3. Metadata: Store source, page numbers, dates
4. Hybrid Search: Combine semantic and keyword search

Common Use Cases:
- Customer support chatbots
- Internal knowledge base search
- Document Q&A systems
- Research assistants
- Legal document analysis
