Python Best Practices for AI Projects

Code Organization:
1. Use virtual environments for dependency isolation
2. Follow PEP 8 style guide for consistent formatting
3. Organize code into modules and packages
4. Keep functions small and focused
5. Use meaningful variable and function names

Error Handling:
- Always use try-except blocks for API calls
- Log errors with proper context
- Fail gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Use specific exception types
- Clean up resources with context managers

Environment Variables:
- Never hardcode API keys or secrets
- Use python-dotenv for local development
- Store sensitive data in .env files
- Add .env to .gitignore
- Use environment variables in production

Type Hints:
- Add type hints to function signatures
- Use typing module for complex types
- Helps with IDE autocomplete
- Makes code self-documenting
- Example: def process_text(text: str) -> List[str]:

Testing:
- Write unit tests for individual functions
- Use pytest for test framework
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions

Performance:
- Profile code before optimizing
- Use appropriate data structures
- Batch API calls when possible
- Cache expensive computations

Logging:
- Use Python's logging module, not print
- Set appropriate log levels
- Include timestamps and context
- Log to files in production

Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
- Mutable default arguments
- Not closing files/connections
- Circular imports
- Ignoring exceptions
- Not validating user input
